TIPS FOR TAKING SCREENSHOTS
================================================================================

1. Use a code editor with line numbers enabled (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
2. Use a readable font size (12-14pt recommended)
3. Use a clean theme (light or dark, your preference)
4. Ensure line numbers are clearly visible
5. Crop screenshots to show only relevant code
6. For terminal output, use full window width
7. Save screenshots as PNG or JPG with descriptive names like:
   - screenshot_01_person_class.png
   - screenshot_02_student_class.png
   - etc.

8. When inserting into your PDF:
   - Place screenshot where indicated in LAB_REPORT.txt
   - Add the caption below each screenshot
   - Ensure screenshots are readable (not too small)

================================================================================
CREATING THE PDF
================================================================================

1. Open LAB_REPORT.txt
2. Copy content into a Word document or Google Docs
3. Insert screenshots at each [SCREENSHOT: ...] location
4. Format the document:
   - Use appropriate headers (Heading 1, 2, 3)
   - Use monospace font for code references
   - Ensure page breaks between major sections
5. Add page numbers
6. Export/Save as PDF
7. Review PDF to ensure all screenshots are clear and readable
