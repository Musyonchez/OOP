================================================================================
                     6. CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

6.1 TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHALLENGE 1: Table Refresh After Data Changes
PROBLEM:
JTable not updating automatically when underlying data changed.

SOLUTION:
Created refreshTable() methods in panels that:
1. Clear existing rows: tableModel.setRowCount(0)
2. Re-add all data from current list
3. Call after every add/edit/delete operation

CODE:
public void refreshTable() {
    tableModel.setRowCount(0);
    for (Student student : students) {
        Object[] row = {...};
        tableModel.addRow(row);
    }
}

LESSON LEARNED:
Swing components don't auto-update. Must manually refresh views after model
changes.


CHALLENGE 2: ComboBox and Tab Coordination
PROBLEM:
When switching between tabs, student selection in GradePanel was lost, and
statistics weren't updating.

SOLUTION:
1. Added ChangeListener to JTabbedPane
2. Refresh statistics panel when Statistics tab selected
3. Keep current student selection when returning to Grades tab

CODE:
tabbedPane.addChangeListener(e -> {
    if (tabbedPane.getSelectedIndex() == 2) {
        statisticsPanel.refreshStatistics();
    }
});

LESSON LEARNED:
Tab changes need explicit handling to keep UI synchronized.


CHALLENGE 3: Dialog Modal Behavior
PROBLEM:
Initially used JFrame for dialogs, which allowed multiple add/edit dialogs
simultaneously, causing confusion.

SOLUTION:
Changed to JDialog with modal=true:
JDialog dialog = new JDialog(parentFrame, "Title", true);

This blocks interaction with main window until dialog is closed.

LESSON LEARNED:
Use modal dialogs for forms to prevent confusion and data integrity issues.


6.2 DESIGN DECISIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECISION 1: Tabbed Interface vs Single Window
CHOICE: Tabbed interface (JTabbedPane)

RATIONALE:
- Cleaner UI, less clutter
- Logical separation of concerns
- Easy navigation
- Industry standard for multi-function apps

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED:
Single scrollable window with all functions

REJECTED BECAUSE:
Would be too crowded and confusing


DECISION 2: File-Based vs Database Storage
CHOICE: Text files with pipe delimiter

RATIONALE:
- Simple to implement
- No external dependencies
- Easy to debug (can view files in text editor)
- Sufficient for assignment scope
- Demonstrates file I/O

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED:
SQLite or embedded database

REJECTED BECAUSE:
- Assignment focus is on Swing, not databases
- Adds complexity without matching learning goals


DECISION 3: Layout Manager Strategy
CHOICE: Different managers for different needs

BORDER LAYOUT: Main panels (regions)
GRID LAYOUT: Buttons, forms (equal sizing)
FLOW LAYOUT: Search bars (horizontal flow)

RATIONALE:
Each layout manager has strengths for specific use cases

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED:
Using only one layout manager throughout

REJECTED BECAUSE:
Would result in poor UI or complex nested panels


6.3 LESSONS LEARNED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. EVENT-DRIVEN PROGRAMMING:
   Understanding that GUI applications are reactive - they respond to user
   actions rather than following a linear flow.

2. SWING COMPONENT HIERARCHY:
   Learning proper nesting of components and how layout managers affect
   appearance.

3. MODEL-VIEW SEPARATION:
   Benefits of separating data (Student, Grade) from display (Panels).

4. USER EXPERIENCE MATTERS:
   Small details like confirmation dialogs, input validation, and helpful
   error messages make big difference.

5. TESTING IMPORTANCE:
   GUI applications need thorough testing of all user interaction paths.

6. CODE ORGANIZATION:
   Modular design with clear package structure makes maintenance easier.
