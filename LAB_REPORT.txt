1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This report documents the implementation of a Student Grade Management System
that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including
classes, objects, variables, constants, methods, loops, and selection
statements.

The system manages student records, calculates averages, validates grades, and
provides comprehensive reporting functionality. The implementation uses Java
and follows OOP best practices.

================================================================================
2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The system consists of 6 Java classes:
- Person.java: Parent class representing a person
- Student.java: Child class extending Person, represents students
- Grade.java: Helper class to store subject grades
- GradeManager.java: Manages collection of students
- InvalidGradeException.java: Custom exception for grade validation
- Main.java: Entry point demonstrating all features

================================================================================
3. IMPLEMENTATION OF OOP CONCEPTS
================================================================================

3.1 CLASSES
------------
The system implements 5 custom classes, each with specific responsibilities:

**Person Class (Parent Class)**
The Person class serves as the base class with common attributes.

2. Invalid grade rejection (< 0 or > 100)
3. Average calculation accuracy
4. Status determination correctness
5. Search functionality
6. Statistics calculation
7. Polymorphic behavior verification

8. CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

Challenge 1: Demonstrating all three loop types naturally
Solution: Used while loop for calculations, do-while for counting, and
for-each for iterations - each where most appropriate.

Challenge 2: Meaningful polymorphism implementation
Solution: Implemented displayInfo() in both Person and Student classes with
method overriding and multiple overloaded versions.

Challenge 3: Realistic exception handling
Solution: Created custom InvalidGradeException for grade validation with
proper try-catch blocks throughout.
