                              FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

REMEMBER:
1. Quality over quantity
2. Test everything before submitting
3. Backup everything
4. Submit early if possible
5. Communicate with team

COMMON LAST-MINUTE ISSUES:
- File size too large → Compress images
- PDF won't open → Try different PDF generator
- Missing screenshots → Follow checklist systematically
- Formatting broken → Use simpler template
- Code won't compile → Test on clean system

CONFIDENCE CHECK:
Can you answer these questions?
[ ] Why did we use abstract classes?
[ ] How does polymorphism work in our late fee system?
[ ] What's the time complexity of our search algorithms?
[ ] How does the file-based database work?
[ ] What design patterns did we use?

If yes to all → YOU'RE READY! ✅
If no to any → Review PROJECT_REPORT.txt Section 2-5

================================================================================
                          GOOD LUCK! 🚀
================================================================================

You've built a comprehensive, well-documented system. Trust your work!
