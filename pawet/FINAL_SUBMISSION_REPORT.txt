================================================================================
                  3. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

This section demonstrates how all four core OOP principles are implemented
in the PAWET-B system.


3.1 ABSTRACTION
---------------

CONCEPT:
Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details while exposing only
essential features. It is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces that
define contracts without specifying how they should be implemented.

IMPLEMENTATION IN PAWET-B:

The Employee class serves as an abstract base class for all employee types:

[SCREENSHOT: Abstraction - Employee Abstract Class]
File: src/models/Employee.java
Lines: 1-50 (showing class declaration, fields, and abstract methods)
Highlight: Lines 12-13 (abstract methods: displayInfo() and getRoleType())

BENEFITS:
• Defines common structure for all employee types
• Enforces implementation of critical methods (displayInfo, getRoleType)
• Allows uniform treatment of different employee types
• Prevents direct instantiation of generic employees
• Supports extensibility for new employee types

3.2 ENCAPSULATION
-----------------

CONCEPT:
Encapsulation bundles data (fields) and methods that operate on that data
within a single unit (class), restricting direct access to internal components
and providing controlled access through public methods.

IMPLEMENTATION IN PAWET-B:

All model classes use private fields with public getters and setters:

[SCREENSHOT: Encapsulation - Manager Class]
File: src/models/Manager.java
Lines: 10-40 (showing private fields, getters, setters with validation)
Highlight: Lines 18-19 (private fields) and Lines 62-66 (setter with validation)

BENEFITS:
• Data protection - fields cannot be accessed directly
• Validation - setters can enforce business rules (e.g., non-negative salary)
• Flexibility - internal implementation can change without affecting users
• Maintainability - changes are localized to the class

VALIDATION EXAMPLES:
• Salary cannot be negative
• Department budget only decreases if sufficient funds available
• Equipment can only be assigned if status is AVAILABLE

[SCREENSHOT 4: Manager Class with Encapsulation]
Caption: Manager.java showing private fields and public getters/setters


3.3 INHERITANCE
---------------

CONCEPT:
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent
class, promoting code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships.

IMPLEMENTATION IN PAWET-B:

The employee hierarchy demonstrates inheritance:

[SCREENSHOT: Inheritance Hierarchy Diagram]
File: docs/flowcharts/6_inheritance_hierarchy.mmd (rendered as PNG)
Description: UML class diagram showing Employee abstract base class with Manager,
Scientist, and Technician subclasses. Shows inherited fields/methods and
specialized fields for each subclass.
Rendering: Use Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/) or VS Code Mermaid
extension to render the diagram, then capture screenshot.

[SCREENSHOT: Inheritance - Manager extends Employee Code]
File: src/models/Manager.java
Lines: 1-45 (showing class declaration, inheritance, constructor with super() call)
Highlight: Line 12 (extends Employee) and Lines 25-30 (super() call to parent constructor)

BENEFITS:
• CODE REUSE: Common fields defined once in Employee
• LOGICAL ORGANIZATION: is-a relationship (Manager is an Employee)
• EXTENSIBILITY: Easy to add new employee types (e.g., Intern, Consultant)
• MAINTENANCE: Changes to common fields happen in one place

3.4 POLYMORPHISM
----------------

CONCEPT:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of
a common parent class, with method calls resolved at runtime based on the
actual object type.

IMPLEMENTATION IN PAWET-B:

Method overriding demonstrates polymorphism:

[SCREENSHOT: Polymorphism - Manager displayInfo() Override]
File: src/models/Manager.java
Lines: 85-100 (displayInfo() method implementation in Manager class)
Highlight: Lines 86-87 (@Override annotation and method signature)

[SCREENSHOT: Polymorphism - Scientist displayInfo() Override]
File: src/models/Scientist.java
Lines: 85-100 (displayInfo() method implementation in Scientist class)
Highlight: Lines 86-87 (@Override annotation showing different implementation)

[SCREENSHOT: Polymorphism - Technician displayInfo() Override]
File: src/models/Technician.java
Lines: 85-100 (displayInfo() method implementation in Technician class)
Highlight: Lines 86-87 (@Override annotation showing third variation)

RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM:

[SCREENSHOT: Polymorphism - Runtime Behavior]
File: src/managers/Organization.java
Lines: 45-60 (showing polymorphic method calls with Employee references)
Highlight: Demonstrate same method name calling different implementations

BENEFITS:
• FLEXIBILITY: Same method name, different behaviors
• EXTENSIBILITY: Add new employee types without changing calling code
• MAINTAINABILITY: Changes localized to specific classes
• ELEGANCE: Clean, intuitive code

================================================================================
                        5. ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

5.1 LINEAR SEARCH ALGORITHM
----------------------------

CONCEPT:
Linear search sequentially checks each element in a list until the target is
found or the list ends. It has O(n) time complexity.

IMPLEMENTATION:

[SCREENSHOT: Linear Search Algorithm Pseudocode]
File: docs/pseudocode/1_search_algorithms.txt
Section: Lines 1-50 (Linear Search by ID pseudocode)
Description: Shows step-by-step pseudocode for linear search implementation with
comparison counting. Includes algorithm logic and return conditions.

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
• Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Best case: O(1) - found at first position
  - Average case: O(n/2) = O(n) - found in middle
  - Worst case: O(n) - found at end or not found

• Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only uses constant extra space for comparisons counter

PERFORMANCE EXAMPLE:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dataset: 25 employees                                              │
│ Search for "M015" (position 15):                                   │
│   Comparisons: 15                                                  │
│   Time: < 1 millisecond                                            │
│                                                                    │
│ Search for "T999" (not found):                                     │
│   Comparisons: 25 (checked all)                                    │
│   Time: < 1 millisecond                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

5.2 BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM
----------------------------

CONCEPT:
Binary search divides the search space in half with each comparison, requiring
sorted data. It has O(log n) time complexity.

IMPLEMENTATION:

[SCREENSHOT: Binary Search Algorithm Pseudocode]
File: docs/pseudocode/1_search_algorithms.txt
Section: Lines 80-140 (Binary Search by ID pseudocode)
Description: Shows divide-and-conquer pseudocode for binary search with comparison
counting and efficiency messaging. Includes left/right pointer logic.

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
• Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - Divides search space in half each iteration
  - Example: 1,000,000 items = only 20 comparisons maximum

• Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Iterative implementation uses constant space

EFFICIENCY COMPARISON:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dataset Size │ Linear Search │ Binary Search │ Speed Improvement  │
│──────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────────│
│      10      │      10       │       4       │    2.5x faster     │
│     100      │     100       │       7       │     14x faster     │
│   1,000      │   1,000       │      10       │    100x faster     │
│  10,000      │  10,000       │      14       │    714x faster     │
│ 100,000      │ 100,000       │      17       │  5,882x faster     │
│ 1,000,000    │ 1,000,000     │      20       │ 50,000x faster     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[SCREENSHOT 15: Binary Search Execution]
Caption: Binary search showing efficiency message comparing to linear search


5.3 BUBBLE SORT ALGORITHM
--------------------------

CONCEPT:
Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and
swaps them if they're in wrong order. It has O(n²) time complexity.

IMPLEMENTATION:

[SCREENSHOT: Bubble Sort Algorithm Pseudocode]
File: docs/pseudocode/2_sort_algorithms.txt
Section: Lines 1-60 (Bubble Sort by Name pseudocode)
Description: Shows nested loop structure for bubble sort with comparison and swap
counting. Includes early termination optimization logic.

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
• Time Complexity: O(n²)
  - Best case: O(n) - already sorted with optimization
  - Average case: O(n²)
  - Worst case: O(n²) - reverse sorted

• Space Complexity: O(1)
  - In-place sorting, no extra arrays

PERFORMANCE EXAMPLE:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dataset: 25 employees                                              │
│ Comparisons: ~300                                                  │
│ Swaps: ~150                                                        │
│ Time: 1-2 milliseconds                                             │
│ Theoretical worst case: 25 × 24 / 2 = 300 comparisons             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[SCREENSHOT 16: Bubble Sort Execution]
Caption: Bubble sort showing detailed statistics (comparisons, swaps, time)


5.4 QUICK SORT ALGORITHM
-------------------------

CONCEPT:
Quick sort uses divide-and-conquer: picks a pivot, partitions array around
pivot, recursively sorts subarrays. Average O(n log n) complexity.

IMPLEMENTATION:

[SCREENSHOT: Quick Sort Algorithm Pseudocode]
File: docs/pseudocode/2_sort_algorithms.txt
Section: Lines 90-150 (Quick Sort by Name pseudocode)
Description: Shows recursive divide-and-conquer approach with partition function.
Includes pivot selection and array partitioning logic.

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
• Time Complexity: O(n log n) average
  - Best case: O(n log n) - balanced partitions
  - Average case: O(n log n)
  - Worst case: O(n²) - rare with good pivot selection

• Space Complexity: O(log n)
  - Recursion stack depth

PERFORMANCE EXAMPLE:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dataset: 25 employees                                              │
│ Comparisons: ~80                                                   │
│ Time: 0.1-0.2 milliseconds                                         │
│ Recursion depth: ~5 levels                                         │

                      10. CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

CHALLENGE 1: Polymorphic Database Storage
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROBLEM:
How to store different employee types (Manager, Scientist, Technician) in
a single database table while preserving type-specific attributes?

SOLUTION:
Created a single employees table with a role_type column and nullable
type-specific columns. When loading from database, use role_type to
instantiate the correct subclass.

[SCREENSHOT: Challenge 1 Solution - Polymorphic Object Creation]
File: src/database/DatabaseManager.java
Lines: 165-180 (loadEmployees method showing role_type-based instantiation)
Highlight: Lines 172-178 (if-else chain creating Manager, Scientist, or Technician)

RESULT: Successfully stores and retrieves polymorphic objects.


CHALLENGE 2: List Serialization
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROBLEM:
SQLite doesn't have native array/list type. How to store Manager's teamList,
Scientist's projectList, Technician's equipmentList?

SOLUTION:
Store as comma-separated strings in TEXT columns. Implement helper methods
for serialization (List → String) and deserialization (String → List).

[SCREENSHOT: Challenge 2 Solution - List Serialization Helper Methods]
File: src/models/Manager.java
Lines: 110-125 (getTeamListAsString and parseTeamList helper methods)
Highlight: String.join(",", teamList) and Arrays.asList(str.split(","))

Alternative: Similar implementation in Scientist.java and Technician.java

RESULT: Seamless conversion between in-memory lists and database storage.


CHALLENGE 3: Binary Search on Unsorted Data
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROBLEM:
Binary search requires sorted data, but users might not realize this.

SOLUTION:
Automatically sort before binary search and inform user.

[SCREENSHOT: Challenge 3 Solution - Auto-Sort for Binary Search]
File: src/managers/Organization.java
Lines: 200-210 (binarySearchById method with automatic sorting)
Highlight: Lines 202-204 (sort operation and user notification)

Alternative: src/utils/SearchAlgorithms.java showing the implementation

RESULT: User gets correct results without needing to sort manually.


CHALLENGE 4: Maintaining Referential Integrity
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROBLEM:
Deleting an employee should update departments, projects, equipment.

SOLUTION:
Cascade updates through Organization coordinator to maintain referential
integrity across departments, projects, and equipment.

[SCREENSHOT: Challenge 4 Solution - Cascade Delete Operations]
File: src/managers/Organization.java
Lines: 135-155 (removeEmployee method showing cascade updates)
Highlight: Lines 138-148 (updating department count, removing from teams, unassigning equipment)

RESULT: Data consistency maintained across all entities.


CHALLENGE 5: Input Validation
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROBLEM:
Invalid user input (non-numeric, wrong date format) causes crashes.

SOLUTION:
Try-catch blocks with re-prompting loop for robust input validation.

[SCREENSHOT: Challenge 5 Solution - Input Validation with Try-Catch]
File: src/Main.java
Lines: 660-675 (getIntInput method showing exception handling)
Highlight: Lines 663-670 (while loop with try-catch and NumberFormatException)

Similar implementations: getDoubleInput(), getDateInput() methods

RESULT: Robust input handling, no crashes from bad input.
